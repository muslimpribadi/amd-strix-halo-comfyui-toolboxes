# AMD Ryzen AI Max “Strix Halo” (64GB-128GB) — ComfyUI Toolbox

A Fedora **toolbox** image with a full **ROCm environment** (TheRock Nightlies / ROCm 7) for **image & video generation** on the **AMD Ryzen AI Max “Strix Halo”** (gfx1151, 64GB-128GB).

This repository provides a pre-configured Docker container to run **ComfyUI** with validated workflows on the **AMD Ryzen AI Max** (64GB-128GB).

## 1. Included Workflows

The repository comes with a collection of ComfyUI workflows pre-validated on this hardware. You can find them in the `workflows/API` directory (mapped to `/opt/comfy-workflows` inside the container).

| Workflow | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HunyuanVideo 1.5** | I2V / T2V | 4-step LoRA, 720p resolution. Configured for 32GB. |
| **Qwen Image** | T2I | Qwen Image 2512 (FP8) & Lightning LoRA (4 steps). |
| **Qwen Image Edit** | Image Editing | Qwen Image Edit 2511 (FP8) & Lightning LoRA (4/20 steps). |
| **Wan 2.2** | I2V / T2V | 14B model with 4-step Lightning LoRA. |

## 2. Toolbox Setup

This project uses `toolbox` (built on Podman) to provide a seamless development environment that integrates with your home directory.

### 2.1. Create the Toolbox

Run the following command on your host to create the container with GPU access:

```bash
toolbox create strix-halo-comfyui \
  --image docker.io/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-comfyui:latest \
  -- --device /dev/dri --device /dev/kfd \
  --group-add video --group-add render --security-opt seccomp=unconfined
```

*   `--device /dev/dri` & `/dev/kfd`: Exposes AMD GPU and compute devices.
*   `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined`: Required for some ROCm/GPU operations.

### 2.2. Enter the Toolbox

```bash
toolbox enter strix-halo-comfyui
```

Once inside, you have access to a full ROCm environment with PyTorch, ComfyUI, and helper scripts in `/opt`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The included `start_comfy_ui` alias launches ComfyUI with `--bf16-vae`, `--disable-mmap`, and `--cache-none`.
> *   **`--bf16-vae`**: Prevents OOM during VAE decoding.
> *   **`--disable-mmap`**: **Critical for Strix Halo (gfx1151)**. Memory mapping above 64GB is currently very slow due to a ROCm issue; disabling it prevents performance degradation and hangs.
> *   **`--cache-none`**: Disables model caching to manage the unified memory more aggressively (`GTT` vs `RAM`).

### 2.3. Updating the Toolbox

To update the container image (e.g., for newer ROCm nightly builds) without deleting your downloaded models (which should be stored in your HOME), use the provided refresh script found in the root of this repo. 

You can run it interactively to select a channel, or pass the channel name as an argument (`latest` or `dev`):

```bash
./refresh-toolbox.sh [latest|dev]
```

- **`latest`**: Stable / verified working build (default, recommended).
- **`dev`**: Development build (may be unstable).

> [!WARNING]
> This will **delete and recreate** the toolbox container. Any files stored *inside* the container system (e.g., `/opt`, `/usr`) will be lost. **Files in your home directory (`~`) are safe.**

---

## 3. First Run Setup (Required)

After entering the toolbox for the first time, you must configure the storage paths and download the model weights.

### Step 1: Configure Persistent Paths

Run the setup script to link ComfyUI's model directories to your home folder (`~/comfy-models`). This ensures you don't download 100GB+ of models every time you refresh the container.

```bash
/opt/set_extra_paths.sh
```

### Step 2: Download Models

Use the **Model Manager TUI** to download the required checkpoints and LoRAs for the included workflows. This tool handles the complex dependency chains (e.g., downloading base models before LoRAs).

```bash
model_manager
```
*(Or `python /opt/model_manager.py`)*

Select the workflow you want to run (e.g., "Wan 2.2 - Text to Video"), and the manager will download the necessary files to `~/comfy-models`.

> **Note:** The manager uses the helper scripts located in `/opt/` (like `get_qwen_image.sh`, `get_wan22.sh`) under the hood. You can run these manually if you prefer CLI arguments.

## 4. Benchmarks

We maintain a list of performance benchmarks for these workflows on the AMD Ryzen AI Max “Strix Halo”.

👉 **View Benchmarks:** [https://kyuz0.github.io/amd-strix-halo-comfyui-toolboxes/](https://kyuz0.github.io/amd-strix-halo-comfyui-toolboxes/)

To run benchmarks yourself:
```bash
python /opt/benchmark_workflows.py
```

## 5. Kernel Log Collection

We are working directly with AMD to improve kernel stability and performance for the Strix Halo (gfx1151). If you encounter performance issues or crashes, you can help by collecting execution logs.

**Tracking Issue:** [ROCm/TheRock#2591](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/2591)

### How to Collect Logs

1.  Make sure you are inside the toolbox.
2.  Run the log collection script:

```bash
python /opt/collect_perf_logs.py
```

This script will:
*   Run the workflows in isolation.
*   Capture `hipblaslt` and `miopen` logs.
*   Save them to the `perf_logs/` directory in your current folder.

Please zip the `perf_logs` folder and attach it to the GitHub issue mentioned above, or share it with the maintainers.

## 6. Maintainer Notes

### Publishing Log Releases

To publish collected performance logs as a GitHub Release (for tracking historical data):

1.  **Zip the logs:**
    ```bash
    zip -r perf_logs_$(date +%Y%m%d).zip perf_logs/
    ```

2.  **Create a Release:**
    ```bash
    gh release create logs-$(date +%Y%m%d) perf_logs_$(date +%Y%m%d).zip \
      --title "Performance Logs $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
      --notes "Logs collected on Strix Halo for kernel analysis."
    ```

| **System Memory**  | 128 GB RAM                                    |
| **GPU Memory**     | 512 MB allocated in BIOS                      |
| **Host OS**        | Fedora 43                                     |
| **Host OS**        | 6.18.4-100.fc43.x86\_64                       |
| **Linux firmware** | 20251111                                      |

### 6.2 Kernel Parameters (tested on Fedora 42)

Add these boot parameters to enable unified memory while reserving a minimum of 4 GiB for the OS (max 124 GiB for iGPU):

`amd_iommu=off amdgpu.gttsize=126976 ttm.pages_limit=32505856`

| Parameter                   | Purpose                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `amd_iommu=off`             | Disables IOMMU for lower latency                                                           |
| `amdgpu.gttsize=126976`     | Caps GPU unified memory to 124 GiB; 126976 MiB ÷ 1024 = 124 GiB                            |
| `ttm.pages_limit=32505856`  | Caps pinned memory to 124 GiB; 32505856 × 4 KiB = 126976 MiB = 124 GiB                     |
